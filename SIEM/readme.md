# SIEM Dashboard Features

## 1. Core Features

### 1.1 Overview/Executive Summary Panel
- **Threat Summary**:
  - Displays critical metrics such as:
    - Total threats detected (e.g., malware, phishing, DDoS).
    - Number of active incidents.
    - Severity breakdown (low, medium, high, critical).
- **Compliance Status**:
  - Highlights adherence to frameworks like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOX.
- **System Health**:
  - Monitors the status of SIEM components (e.g., log collectors, analytics engine).

### 1.2 Log and Event Monitoring
- **Real-Time Log Viewer**:
  - Displays a live feed of logs from sources like firewalls, applications, servers, and databases.
- **Source-Based View**:
  - Segregates logs by source (e.g., endpoint, network device, cloud service).
- **Search and Filter**:
  - Advanced filtering options based on:
    - Event type (e.g., login attempts, file access).
    - Time range.
    - Specific entities (user, IP, hostname).

## 2. Threat Detection and Analysis

### 2.1 Threat Map
- **Geolocation Visualization**:
  - Real-time map of attack origins and destinations.
  - Visual indication of blocked or mitigated threats.
- **Anomalous Patterns**:
  - Highlights unusual activity, such as access from untrusted geolocations or devices.

### 2.2 Alerts and Notifications
- **Real-Time Alerts**:
  - Display ongoing alerts with details such as source, severity, and timestamp.
  - Highlight high-priority incidents in red or with animations.
- **Alert Drill-Down**:
  - Detailed view for each alert, including:
    - Event timeline.
    - Associated users, IPs, and systems.
    - Recommended response actions.

### 2.3 Threat Intelligence
- **Threat Feed Integration**:
  - Insights from external feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, IBM X-Force, STIX/TAXII).
  - Correlation of internal logs with known threat indicators.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**:
  - Quick access to identified IoCs like malicious IPs, domains, or file hashes.

## 3. Incident Management

### 3.1 Incident Summary
- List of open, in-progress, and resolved incidents.
- Status indicators: "New," "Under Investigation," "Escalated," "Resolved."

### 3.2 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Timeline of events leading to an incident.
- Key contributing factors (e.g., unpatched vulnerability, misconfigured policy).

### 3.3 Automated Responses
- View of triggered responses (e.g., blocked IPs, quarantined files).
- Manual override options for automated actions.

## 4. Compliance and Audit

### 4.1 Compliance Dashboard
- **Status of adherence to**:
  - PCI DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.
- **Log retention reports and audit readiness.**

### 4.2 User Access Monitoring
- Suspicious login attempts (e.g., failed login trends).
- Privileged account activity.

### 4.3 Policy Violations
- Summary of detected policy violations (e.g., unauthorized data access).
- Trends over time for non-compliance incidents.

## 5. Performance and Metrics

### 5.1 Event Statistics
- **Event Volume**:
  - Total number of logs processed over time.
- **Log Sources**:
  - Top contributors by log volume.

### 5.2 System Health
- Resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, disk).
- Status of integrations (e.g., log collectors, alerting tools).

### 5.3 Trends and Forecasts
- Historical trends in threat activity.
- Predictive analytics for upcoming threats (if AI/ML models are integrated).
