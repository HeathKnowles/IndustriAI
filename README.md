# 🚀 Zero Trust Cloud-Native Platform for Financial Security

## 📖 Overview

This project proposes an innovative **Zero Trust Network Security Framework** designed to tackle the significant challenges financial institutions face regarding **data security**, **compliance**, and **threat mitigation** in cloud environments.

Our platform implements advanced techniques like **🔐 fine-grained Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**, **🛡️ request fingerprinting**, and seamless **⚡ SIEM integration** for enhanced real-time threat detection and monitoring.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🛡️ Zero Trust Principles**: Adopts a Zero Trust model, ensuring all access requests are thoroughly verified, even within the network perimeter.
- **🔐 Fine-Grained Access Control**: Utilizes **ABAC** for dynamic policy enforcement based on real-time request attributes.
- **📊 Request Fingerprinting**: Provides detailed visibility into request activities, improving threat identification.
- **⚡ SIEM Integration**: Logs all access activities for real-time detection and security monitoring via **Security Information and Event Management** systems.

## 🔄 Workflow and Implementation

### 🔍 A Comprehensive Request Lifecycle:

1. **🛠️ Request Interception**  
   Incoming requests are intercepted by the **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** and critical attributes are extracted.

2. **📋 Policy Evaluation**  
   Attributes are passed to the **Policy Decision Point (PDP)** for evaluation using ABAC logic.

3. **✔️ Access Decision**  
   The **PDP** grants or denies access based on the evaluated policies, with outcomes logged for security compliance.

4. **📈 SIEM Monitoring**  
   Access logs are integrated into the **SIEM system** for real-time security monitoring and analysis.
